- 👋 Hi, I’m @WanRitz1
- 👀 I’m interested in developing E-commerce Website.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React to build my own portfolio. I am new to building websites and I am looking for a mentor that can guide me to be a freelance web developer. 
I have basics understanding of programming (etc Java). I am looking to broaden my knowledge in programming as I plan for a new career.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a simple E-commerce website for small businesses to allow offline businesses to promote their services or products online.
- 📫 If anyone interested to collaborate or assist to guide as a mentor, please feel free to drop me a mail at surprisebox360@yahoo.com
